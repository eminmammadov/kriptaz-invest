# Web3 Infrastructure: Building the Decentralized Internet

Web3 represents a paradigm shift toward a decentralized internet built on blockchain technology. This comprehensive analysis examines the infrastructure components that power the Web3 ecosystem and their role in building the decentralized internet of the future.

## Understanding Web3

Web3, or Web 3.0, refers to the next generation of the internet that is decentralized, user-controlled, and built on blockchain technology. It represents a fundamental shift from the current centralized web (Web 2.0) to a more open, transparent, and user-centric internet.

### Core Principles
1. **Decentralization**: No single point of control or failure
2. **User Ownership**: Users control their own data and digital assets
3. **Trustless**: Interactions without need for trusted intermediaries
4. **Permissionless**: Open access without gatekeepers
5. **Interoperability**: Seamless interaction between different systems
